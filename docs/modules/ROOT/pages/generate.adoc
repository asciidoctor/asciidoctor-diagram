= Rendering Diagrams

You can load Asciidoctor diagram in a terminal using the `-r` flag.

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-diagram sample.adoc

You can also use Asciidoctor diagram with other converters, such as Asciidoctor EPUB.
Asciidoctor-epub3 is also loaded with the `-r` flag.

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-diagram -r asciidoctor-epub3 -b epub3 sample.adoc

Or, you can invoke Asciidoctor and the EPUB converter with the `asciidoctor-epub3` command.
The command implicitly sets the `-r` and `-b` flags for EPUB3 output.

 $ asciidoctor-epub3 -r asciidoctor-diagram sample.adoc
