= PlantUML
include::partial$uris.adoc[]

{uri-plantuml}[PlantUML] is a syntax and tool to draw UML diagrams, using a simple and human readable text description.
It is particularly well-suited for users who prefer a simple, text-based approach to creating diagrams, and who want a tool that can automatically handle the layout and appearance of their diagrams.

PlantUML is automatically available via the https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-diagram-plantuml[asciidoctor-diagram-plantuml] gem.
This gem contains the LGPL build of PlantUML jar and its dependencies.

PlantUML requires Java version 1.8 or higher to be installed.
