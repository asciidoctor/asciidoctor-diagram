{uri-structurizr}[Structurizr] builds upon "diagrams as code", allowing you to create multiple software architecture diagrams from a single model.
There are a number of tools for creating Structurizr compatible workspaces, with the Structurizr DSL being the recommended option for most teams.

The Structurizr extension allows individual views from a Structurizr DSL workspace to be included in Asciidoc documents.
This is the inverse use case of https://structurizr.com/help/documentation[Structurizr's documentation] support which lets you embed Asciidoc in the Structurizr DSL.

This extension uses the https://structurizr.com/help/cli[Structurizr CLI] tool to convert Structurizr DSL or JSON workspace files into the input for a renderer.
The chosen renderer is then used to generate the final image.

The installation location of Structurizr CLI needs to be passed to asciidoctor-diagram using the `DIAGRAM_STRUCTURIZRCLI_HOME`.
When running Asciidoctor with JRuby or when using AsciidoctorJ the installation location can also be specified using the `diagram.structurizrcli.home` Java system property.
In both cases it should be set to the absolute directory containing the extracted Structurizr CLI archive.

 Structurizr requires Java version 17 or higher to be installed.
